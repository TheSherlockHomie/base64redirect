# base64redirect
_An Open Search compliant API to decrypt and redirect to base64 encoded URLs_

Sick of the extra clicks required to decrypt a base64 encoded URL, copy it, and then paste it in your browser?
You now have a solution! Add the search to your browser, and you'll be automagically be redirected to the decrypted website!
And even if the base64 string is not a website, you'll be presented with the decrypted string.

P.S. This is currently WIP, and might not work (at all)
